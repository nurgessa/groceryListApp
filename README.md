# Grocery List Web Application

This is a simple React web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and maintain a grocery list. Authentication is handled using `localStorage`, and routing is managed with React Router.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in. Their credentials are stored in `localStorage`.
- **Grocery List Management**: Users can add items to their grocery list. The list is stored in `localStorage`, so it persists across sessions.
- **Routing**: The app uses React Router for navigation.
